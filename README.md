## How I Made It

1. **Planning and Design**  
    Before diving into coding, I planned the structure and design of the website. This involved:
    - Sketching wireframes for each page.
    - Choosing a color palette that matches the theme of the website.
    - Selecting fonts from Google Fonts that are easy to read and aesthetically pleasing.

2. **Setting Up the Project**  
    I created a new project directory and initialized a Git repository to keep track of changes. I also set up a basic HTML structure for the website.

3. **Adding Bootstrap**  
    To speed up the development process and ensure a responsive design, I included Bootstrap in the project.

4. **Creating the Navbar**  
    I used Bootstrap's navbar component to create a fixed and stylized navigation bar. This made it easy for users to navigate through different sections of the website.

5. **Building the Homepage**  
    The homepage was designed to be easy to navigate and visually pleasing. I used Copilot to generate the Hero image.

6. **Adding a Carousel**  
    To showcase different features and benefits of the app, I added a stylized carousel using Bootstrap's carousel component.

7. **Creating Modals**  
    For additional information and user interactions, I included stylized modals. These were implemented using Bootstrap's modal component.

8. **Footer and Additional Pages**  
    I created a stylized footer with links to the About section, Contact page, Privacy policy page, and social media links. Each of these pages was designed to be consistent with the overall theme of the website.

9. **Adding Content**  
    I populated the website with content, I used Copilot to write large paragraphs of text. I used images from thispersondoesnotexist.com for user faces.

10. **Adding a Favicon**  
     I added a favicon to the website to enhance branding. The favicon was generated using favicon.io.

11. **Testing**  
     I thoroughly tested the website to ensure it was responsive and free of bugs.
